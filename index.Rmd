This space is in progress, so keep calm. And it is for now, live - meaning it is made available at the same time as it is being written. So expect changes, additions, etc.

## Preamble
___

The intent of this space if to provide general instructions in the use of R with specific focus on fisheries data that are generally collected in the CRFM region. It is in part of Einar Hj√∂rleifsson ([see CRFM press release](http://www.crfm.int/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=544:top-fisheries-data-expert-from-iceland-shares-expertise-with-crfm-countries&Itemid=179)) short term assignment at the CRFM St. Vincent office in the first two months of 2017.

The content of this space is split into two main section: An introduction into R with emphasis on data visualization, munging, summarisation and presentation followed by a section of (hopefully) regional case examples.

It is anticipated that the scripts provided will aid those that would like to get started in using R as well as for those that would like to get more experience in using R. The list of case examples below should be considered incomplete as of now. Emphasis will be put on using practical regional cases that may serve as a seeder for scientists own work. Depending on enthusiasm the list of case example may grow after the short term assignment at the St. Vincent in the first two months of 2017.

The CRFM fisheries scientists community (current focus is the Data and Methods Working Group, which already have had some R courses) is encouraged to run the scripts themselves at their own pace. When issues arise (they will), you can send me an email (einar.hjorleifson at gmail.com) or what would be preferable send an email to the data and methods dgroup.
