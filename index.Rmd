This space is in progress, so keep calm.

## Preamble
___

The content of this space is split into two main section: A short introduction into R with emphasis on data munging, summarisation and presentation followed by a section of (hopefully) regional case examples.

It is anticipated that the scripts provided will aid those that would like to get started in using R as well as for those that would like to get more experience in using R. The CRFM fisheries scientists community (current focus is the Data and Methods Working Group) is encoured to run the scripts themselves at their own pace. When issues arise, you can send me an email (einar.hjorleifson at gmail.com) or what would be preferrable send an email to the data and methods dgroup.

The background/motivation for the work can currently be found [here](README.html).
