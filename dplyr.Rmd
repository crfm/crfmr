__Suggested reading material__: Chapter 5 on Data transformation in the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) book.

On the RStudio site there is also a nice [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)


## Needed libraries for this tutorial:
```{r, warning = FALSE, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readxl)
#library(lubridate)
library(png)
library(grid)
```


## Getting the example data into R

The data we are going to use is [the web](http://www.hafro.is/~einarhj/crfmr/data-raw/SAU_FAO_31_v44-1.csv). It can be downloaded onto your computer by clicking on the link or what is better (because it becomes repoducable) download the data on to your computer (only have to do this once, the file is big):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
download.file("http://www.hafro.is/~einarhj/crfmr/data-raw/SAU_FAO_31_v44-1.csv",
              "SAU_FAO_31_v44-1.csv")
```
and then read in the data each time you want to work on it:
```{r}
sau <- read.csv("SAU_FAO_31_v44-1.csv",
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Quick overview of the data

```{r}
glimpse(sau)
```



# Grammar of data

The tidyverse package, through the dplyr and tidyr, are a set of tools for a common set of problems connected to aggregates or summaries of data.

* Similar to ggplot2 they feature a Domain Specific Language (DSL) specially designed for data summaries.
* Developed by Hadley Wickam, the creator ggplot2 and other useful tools.

Commonly, when collating summaries by group, one wants to:

* **Split** up a big data structure into homogeneous pieces,
* **Apply** a function to each piece
* **Combine** all the results back together.


![](img/split-apply-combine.png)


For example, one might want to

* quickly calculate summary statistics by species
* perform group-wise transformations like scaling or standardizing
* fit the same model to different ...

# dplyr

Essentially dplyr offers a collection of simple but powerful verbs (functions) that facilitate this split-apply-combined process:

* **filter**: keep rows matching criteria
* **select**: pick or drop columns by name
* **arrange**: order the rows according to a variable
* **mutate**: add new variables
* **summarise**: reduce variables to values
* **group_by**: gives the group to apply the analysis functions to 

The structure of these commands is always the same:

* First argument is a data frame
* Always return a data frame
* Subsequent arguments say what to do with data frame
* (Never modify in place)
* It recognizes the columns of the data.frame as variables, that is only need to call `col.name` instead of `dat$col.name`

## Select

![](img/select.png)

```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/select.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Select only certain columns 
```{r}
sau.redux <- 
  select(sau, year, common_name, tonnes)
glimpse(sau.redux)
```

select all columns except `area_name` and `area_type`:
```{r}
sau.redux <- 
  select(sau, -area_name, -area_type)
glimpse(sau.redux)
```

Other useful helper function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# not run
select(sau, starts_with("fishing"))     # Select all columns that start with "fishing"
select(sau, ends_with("name"))          # Select all columns that end with "name"
select(sau, scientific_name:catch_type) # Select all columns between "scientific_name" and "catch_type"
select(sau, contains("group"))          # Select all columns that contains "group"
```

Select also allows you to rename columns:
```{r}
sau.redux <- 
  select(sau, year, country = fishing_entity, name = common_name, tonnes)
glimpse(sau.redux)
```

but this also removes columns. 

## Rename

![](img/rename.png)

Instead of changing variable name with select (as shown above) one can use `rename`. The difference is that all original columns are intact. Lets for sake of sanity do that here on the original data frame (i.e. we overwrite the `sau` dataframe):

```{r}
sau <- 
  rename(sau,
         area = area_name,
         type = area_type,
         latin = scientific_name,
         species = common_name,
         bgroup = functional_group,
         cgroup = commercial_group,
         country = fishing_entity,
         sector = fishing_sector,
         cclass = catch_type,
         status = reporting_status,
         value = landed_value)
glimpse(sau)
```

Lets also get rid of the column area, type and latin.

```{r}
sau <- select(sau, -area, -type, -latin)
```

## Filter

![](img/filter.png)

One can create a subset of the data using the `filter` command:
```{r}
sau.dominica <-
  filter(sau,
         country == "Dominica")
glimpse(sau.dominica)
```

and filter even further (here two countries and one commerical group):
```{r}
sau.dominica.tunas <-
  filter(sau,
         country %in% c("Dominica", "Barbados"),
         cgroup == "Tuna & billfishes")
glimpse(sau.dominica.tunas)
```

Filter can use any logical statement:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
 a == b   ## a is equal to b
 a != b   ## a is not equal to b
 a > b    ## a is greater than b
 a >= b   ## a is greater or equal to b
 a < b    ## a is less than b
 a <= b   ## a is less or equal to b
 a & b    ## a and b
 a | b    ## a or b
 !a       ## not a
 is.na(a) ## is a equal to NA (missing)
 a %in% b ## elements of column a that are also in b 
```

A related function is the `slice` function, that simply filters the data by row number. E.g. to filter the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th and the 100th row one can do:
```{r}
sau.slice <- 
  slice(sau, c(1,4:6,100))
glimpse(sau.slice)
```

## Arrange

![](img/arrange.png)


Arrange by species name (in ascending order):
```{r}
sau.arr <- arrange(sau, species)
glimpse(sau.arr)
```

and in descending order:
```{r}
sau.darr <- arrange(sau, desc(year))
glimpse(sau.darr)
```

You can also arrange by more that one column:
```{r}
sau.arr2 <- arrange(sau, desc(year), species)
glimpse(sau.arr2)
```

## Mutate

![](img/mutate.png)

NOTE: Need to check what the unit of the value is

```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/mutate.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Mutate allows you to add new columns to your data. Let's e.g. calculate the value per kg
```{r}
sau.vperkg <-
  mutate(sau,
         value_per_kg = value/(tonnes * 1000))
```

You can also do more than one "mutation", e.g. here we convert tonnes to kilograms and then use that variable to calculate value per kilogram
```{r}
sau.vperkg <-
  mutate(sau,
         kg = tonnes/1000,
         value_per_kg = value/kg)
```

## Summarise

![](img/summarise.png)

```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/summarise.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Useful to create (not so) simple summaries of the data
```{r}
sau.summ <- 
  summarise(sau, 
            stonnes = sum(tonnes, na.rm = TRUE),
            svalue  = sum(value,  na.rm = TRUE))
```

Useful helper function
```{r,eval=FALSE}
n()             ## counts the number of rows
n_distinct(x)   ## counts the number distinct values of x
first(x)        ## first value of x
last(x)         ## last value of x
nth(x,n)        ## nth value of x  
```

For example, if we want to calculate the number of records, number species, biological and commercial groups:

```{r}
sau.summ2 <- 
  summarise(sau,
            n = n(),
            nspecies = n_distinct(species),
            nbgroup =  n_distinct(bgroup),
            ncgroup =  n_distinct(cgroup))
sau.summ2
```


## Group_by

![](img/group_by.png)

```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/group_summarise.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Summarize is somewhat useful on its own but become much more useful when combined with a `group_by` statement

* **group_by** Group data into rows with the same value of (a) particular variable(s)
* **ungroup** Remove grouping information from data frame

```{r}
sau.group <- 
  group_by(sau, country)
sau.group
```

In the above code we have grouped the data by country (note the second line). If we now repeat the summary calculation we did above on the grouped dataframe (sau.group) we get the summary by each country:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sau.summ3 <- 
  summarise(sau.group,
            n = n(),
            nspecies = n_distinct(species),
            nbgroup =  n_distinct(bgroup),
            ncgroup =  n_distinct(cgroup))
sau.summ3
```

We can use the `group_by` function on more than one column, e.g. by country and catch-class and then apply some summary statistics:
```{r}
sau.group2 <- 
  group_by(sau, country, cclass)
sau.summ4 <- 
  summarise(sau.group2,
            n = n(),
            nspecies = n_distinct(species),
            nbgroup =  n_distinct(bgroup),
            ncgroup =  n_distinct(cgroup))
sau.summ4
```

## Combining dplyr verbs

In R one can apply functions to data repeatedly:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
sau.summ <- 
  arrange(summarise(group_by(select(sau, country, tonnes), country), n=n(), stonnes = sum(tonnes)), desc(stonnes))
sau.summ
```

The problem here is that this is very hard to read because in order to understand what has been done one has to read the code from __inside out__. What one can read can be written in some kind of a pseudo code:

* select columns country and tonnes from the sau dataframe
* group it by country
* provide summary statistic of the number of records and the sum of the total catches
* arrange it by the total catch in descending order (countries with highest catch first).

## The `%>%` operator

dplyr allows chaining of operations using the $\%>\%$ (pipe). By use of the pipe one can get the same as above by:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sau %>% 
  select(country, tonnes) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            stonnes = sum(tonnes)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(stonnes))
```

This needs a bit of explaining. Instead of calling a function with `f(x,y)` you can do `x %>% f(y)`, that is "take x, then apply f with a setting y". This essentially means that `%>%` operator takes the stuff on the left and places it as the first argument to function on the right hand side. 
If we take e.g. the first bit of code above:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# not run
sau %>% 
  select(country, tonnes)
```

It basically means that we pass the dataframe sau as the first argument in the select function.
